00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
Hello, my check.

00:04.880 --> 00:07.120
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

00:09.280 --> 00:14.080
Thank you. You all look absolutely amazing in your formal outfits today.

00:15.200 --> 00:20.720
Honestly, it's hard to take my eyes off you. And yes, I see those smiles.

00:21.680 --> 00:25.280
I like that energy. All right, let's get started.

00:26.160 --> 00:35.600
Your pin drops silence and your full attention will help me present the Webber Mind Apps annual

00:35.600 --> 00:44.160
growth story in the best possible way. Dear WebMind Apps family, today is not just another day.

00:45.040 --> 00:53.920
Today is a moment to pause. Look back and feel proud. Proud of 13 years of courage.

00:55.280 --> 01:04.400
Proud of 13 years of growth. Proud of 13 years of people who believed in a dream and never gave

01:04.400 --> 01:11.840
up on it. Today, we are not just celebrating 13 years. We are celebrating a journey, a journey

01:11.840 --> 01:18.000
that started with two young minds, no market knowledge, no road map, no experience in running

01:18.000 --> 01:24.800
a company, only courage, commitment and countless challenges in hunting for projects. And they did not

01:24.800 --> 01:33.120
stop there. Today, that same dream stands tall as a 45-member organization powered by a bold

01:33.120 --> 01:40.160
vision and a deep belief that quality work can transform businesses. With great pride that I

01:40.160 --> 01:47.680
welcome you all to one of our greatest milestones. 13 years of success and the celebration of our

01:47.680 --> 01:54.080
anniversary event. We beverse 13. Hooray! A big round of applause, please.

01:56.400 --> 02:03.840
Thank you. Let us see 2025 Technology Upgrade Report.

02:05.440 --> 02:11.600
We are a growing company and technology enhancement is something must. We learned, we improved,

02:11.600 --> 02:16.640
we delivered. Let us take a look into the tech stack we upscale to. Shoppy 5 Plus,

02:16.640 --> 02:24.960
an enterprise e-commerce, headless CMS and next JS. Performance focused platforms, 3D, WebGL

02:24.960 --> 02:31.120
and immersive experiences, motion graphics, 3D animations and modelling, automation,

02:31.120 --> 02:39.280
security and scalable systems, AI voice and chat agents. Oh, it's me. Thank you.

02:39.920 --> 02:48.000
Joke's a part. And finally, our A.G. based AI solutions. This transformation didn't happen

02:48.000 --> 03:00.800
overnight. It happened because of you all. Persistence. And purpose. Come on team, let's hear a louder

03:01.600 --> 03:14.160
applause. Thank you. Now let us see 2025 quality that we set. Last year marked a shift from

03:14.160 --> 03:20.240
execution to excellence. Today, Webo Mind Apps follows structured project kickoffs,

03:20.240 --> 03:29.280
clear MOMs and SOPs. Defined escalation matrices, SLA tracking, multi-level QA cycles,

03:29.280 --> 03:37.440
strong security practices. This discipline ensures one thing. Quality is never compromised.

03:37.440 --> 03:43.760
That is why clients stay. That is why retainers grow. That is why trust keeps multiplying.

03:44.960 --> 03:50.560
But I heard Miss Ramya's loud voice at designing team recently. And was it about quality issues?

03:51.680 --> 03:58.080
Joke's a part. No doubt on quality we have gone way ahead. Can I get the cheerful

03:58.160 --> 04:08.160
applause please? Thank you. Now, let us see 2025 recruitment numbers.

04:09.680 --> 04:16.240
If there is one year that truly defines our growth, it is the last year. The number of resources

04:16.240 --> 04:22.960
hired was high compared to previous years. Nearly 8,000 applications from Naakri, our website,

04:22.960 --> 04:30.560
LinkedIn, reference, phone calls, etc. We have hired 22 resources last year. We added new team

04:30.560 --> 04:37.840
like motion graphic designing team. Next, JS and Node.js team, accounts team, which we did not

04:37.840 --> 04:43.040
had before. Where is Priya? Oh, I can see her. There she is.

04:43.120 --> 04:52.960
Great work by recruitment team and members who supported in taking up the interviews.

04:54.320 --> 04:58.240
Come on new joiners. I'm talking about a round of applause.

05:00.640 --> 05:08.560
Thank you. Now, let's see the big projects that we delivered in 2025.

05:09.360 --> 05:20.080
A cross-fintech, agri-tech, manufacturing, e-commerce, and SaaS. Projects like fine labs,

05:20.080 --> 05:26.560
crop-in, data-nab, webshop, trinomix, Honda race-coverry, KP Manish,

05:27.200 --> 05:32.400
aero-wire, aero-s innovation, cyber-treks, both campus and many more.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.880
These weren't just websites. They created branding impact,

05:36.880 --> 05:40.800
business growth, and market credibility. Team, did I miss anything?

05:42.960 --> 05:46.880
Oh, how could you forget with so? It's all about me.

05:48.160 --> 05:51.680
Ah, I don't need an applause. I can give myself.

05:56.720 --> 06:00.960
Now, important part of the report, 2025, the growth report.

06:02.560 --> 06:07.760
In the past year alone, Webamined apps achieved a 41% revenue growth.

06:08.560 --> 06:12.720
But more than numbers, what truly matters is how we grew.

06:15.040 --> 06:20.960
Team growth from 30 to 42 new departments built stronger internal processes.

06:20.960 --> 06:25.040
Bigger and more complex projects and wider global footprint.

06:25.360 --> 06:32.880
Today's 60% of our work serves India, and 40% serves international markets.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.600
This growth was intentional. This growth was earned.

06:40.720 --> 06:43.120
Founder's journey, the real story.

06:45.840 --> 06:53.120
Behind every success, there is a sacrifice. I'm talking about Mr. Manikanda Pandian.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.680
Traveling every month from Dubai to Bangalore and Bangalore to Dubai,

06:58.400 --> 07:04.640
managing two locations, it's really not easy to stay away from the family and homemade food.

07:05.600 --> 07:09.760
Being founder, who always initiate to find due pathway to grow the company,

07:10.400 --> 07:17.120
his innovation towards automation, marketing, and training. His soft and gentle approach

07:17.200 --> 07:24.880
is always recognized by every resource. A big round of applause to this great leader.

07:27.440 --> 07:35.280
He could be leader to you. He's very special to me. His innocent smile and fearless eyes and

07:36.720 --> 07:40.800
okay, okay, okay. I forgot. I am in an anniversary celebration.

07:41.280 --> 07:48.960
Standing strong alongside this journey is Ramiya, co-founder of Webo Mind Apps.

07:48.960 --> 07:54.400
Every day she has been holding together. People, projects, and promises,

07:54.400 --> 07:59.280
handling multiple resources, managing multiple clients, listening deeply,

07:59.280 --> 08:04.080
understanding ambitions, and turning challenges into real solutions.

08:04.160 --> 08:07.760
She didn't just bring projects. She brought belief.

08:10.080 --> 08:17.040
Belief to clients that Webo Mind Apps can deliver. Belief to teams that their work matters.

08:17.040 --> 08:23.120
From closing large and complex deals to giving clients clarity, confidence, and hope,

08:23.120 --> 08:27.120
and ensuring every commitment is successfully delivered through the team.

08:28.400 --> 08:33.920
Her role in sales, communication, and execution has been one of the strongest pillars

08:34.320 --> 08:41.200
of Webo Mind Apps growth. She is good, but not like Mr. Manikanda Pandian.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.840
Anyways, let's give a round of applause for them.

08:46.320 --> 08:52.640
Founders cannot walk alone. A special mention to Ramakrishna, our operations manager,

08:52.640 --> 08:59.600
Carmen Chaos, steady under pressure, handling HR operations, administration, and resource coordination.

09:00.320 --> 09:04.160
Ensuring smooth functioning even during high-pressure phases.

09:06.400 --> 09:11.440
I know why he's silent always. He's not led to speak anywhere by her.

09:13.680 --> 09:16.480
Come on, guys. He deserves a round of applause.

09:19.120 --> 09:23.840
Can't stop here. A heartfelt thank you to our long-term pillars.

09:23.840 --> 09:26.560

Your consistency, ownership, and dedication are the backbone of Webo Mind Apps.

09:45.440 --> 09:51.280
To every team member who joined us recently, definitely, your names may not be spoken individually

09:51.280 --> 09:59.520
today, but your impact is felt every single day. Design, development, marketing, content,

09:59.520 --> 10:11.360
motion, SEO, sales, HR, accounts, DevOps, every role matters, every effort counts.

10:12.240 --> 10:17.680

10:17.760 --> 10:23.120

Vibhu Mind Apps.

10:46.400 --> 10:51.520

10:51.520 --> 10:54.320
Happy 13th Anniversary, Rebo Mind Apps family.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.880
Signing off. Anya.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.560
Anniversary, narration script.

11:02.080 --> 11:08.160
Internal, tone, emotional, inspirational, founder-led, gratitude focused.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.760
Duration. Approximately 8 to 9 minutes.

11:11.760 --> 11:12.400
Opening.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.000
Hello. My check.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.320
Can I have everyone's attention please?

11:20.000 --> 11:25.040
Thank you. You all look absolutely amazing in your formal outfits today.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.760
Honestly, it's hard to take my eyes off you.

11:28.320 --> 11:32.800
And yes, I see those smiles. I like that energy.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.480
All right, let's get started.

11:34.560 --> 11:37.920
Your pin drop silence and your full attention

11:37.920 --> 11:43.120
will help me present the Webo Mind Apps annual growth story in the best possible way.

11:43.120 --> 11:46.560
Dear Webo Mind Apps family, today is not just another day.

11:47.200 --> 11:51.360
Today is a moment to pause. Look back and feel proud.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.240
Cloud of 13 years of courage.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.720
Proud of 13 years of growth.

11:57.680 --> 12:02.720
Proud of 13 years of people who believed in a dream and never gave up on it.

12:02.720 --> 12:05.920
Today, we are not just celebrating 13 years.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.840
We are celebrating a journey.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.640
A journey that started with two young minds.

12:10.640 --> 12:15.120
No market knowledge, no road map, no experience in running a company,

12:15.120 --> 12:20.000
only courage, commitment and countless challenges in hunting for projects.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.680
And they did not stop there.

12:21.680 --> 12:27.040
Today, that same dream stands tall as a 45-member organization.

12:27.520 --> 12:33.520
Powered by a bold vision and a deep belief that quality work can transform businesses

12:33.520 --> 12:38.880
with great pride that I welcome you all to one of our greatest milestones.

12:39.600 --> 12:44.800
13 years of success and the celebration of our anniversary event, RebaWers.

12:45.680 --> 12:49.120
Who a big round of applause please.

12:49.120 --> 12:49.680
Thank you.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.040
Then and now.

12:53.680 --> 12:59.280
In the early days, we built basic websites and simple digital solutions.

12:59.280 --> 13:02.160
We learned, we failed, we improved.

13:02.160 --> 13:05.040
And with every project, we grew stronger.

13:05.040 --> 13:09.040
Today, WebO Mind Apps is a technology-driven digital partner,

13:09.040 --> 13:11.680
delivering AI voice and chat agents,

13:11.680 --> 13:17.360
RIG-based AI solutions, Shopify Plus and Enterprise e-commerce,

13:17.360 --> 13:20.560
headlesscms and next.js,

13:21.520 --> 13:27.200
performance-focused platforms, 3D, webgel and immersive experiences,

13:28.240 --> 13:31.600
automation, security and scalable systems.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.000
This transformation didn't happen overnight.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.760
It happened because of people, persistence and purpose.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.160
Last year, the turning point.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.880
If there is one year that truly defines our growth,

13:44.880 --> 13:46.000
it is the last year.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.360
In the past year alone, WebO Mind Apps achieved a 41% revenue growth.

13:51.360 --> 13:55.520
But more than numbers, what truly matters is how we grew

13:55.520 --> 13:57.760
team growth from 30 to 42.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.760
New departments built.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.160
Stronger internal processes.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.880
Bigger and more complex projects.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.760
And a wider global footprint.

14:07.760 --> 14:13.200
Today, 60% of our work serves India and 40% serves international markets.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.800
This growth was intentional.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.200
This growth was earned.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.200
Quality and process maturity.

14:20.800 --> 14:25.360
Last year marked a shift from execution to excellence.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.600
Today, WebO Mind Apps follows.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.520
Structured project kickoffs.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.600
Clear MOMs and SOPs.

14:31.600 --> 14:34.000
Defined escalation matrices.

14:34.000 --> 14:34.960
SLA tracking.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.440
Multi-level QA cycles.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.360
Strong security practices.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.120
This discipline ensures one thing.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.000
Quality is never compromised.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.600
That is why clients stay.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.680
That is why retailers grow.

14:48.240 --> 14:51.360
That is why trust keeps multiplying.

14:51.360 --> 14:52.480
Technology leap.

14:54.480 --> 14:58.640
The last year was also a bold leap forward in technology.

14:58.640 --> 15:02.160
WebO Mind Apps embraced AI agents like India.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.960
R&G architectures with pine cone.

15:05.760 --> 15:07.920
Next are JS and Headless CMS.

15:08.720 --> 15:09.680
Shopify Plus.

15:10.560 --> 15:11.920
3D and WebGL.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.080
Automation workflows.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.320
Performance optimization.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.800
Enterprise great security.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.800
We didn't just adopt technology.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.240
We evolved with it.

15:22.240 --> 15:24.160
Projects that created impact.

15:25.680 --> 15:29.120
This year, WebO Mind Apps delivered high impact,

15:29.120 --> 15:31.520
complex enterprise-level projects.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.680
Across FinTech, AgriTech,

15:33.680 --> 15:36.240
Manufacturing, e-commerce and SaaS.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.960
Projects like Pine Labs,

15:39.040 --> 15:42.160
Crop in, DataNub, WebShop,

15:42.160 --> 15:44.800
Trinomix, Honda Riscovery,

15:44.800 --> 15:47.280
KP Manish, AeroWire,

15:47.280 --> 15:49.920
ErosInnovation, Cybertracks,

15:49.920 --> 15:52.400
Botcampus and many more.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.160
These weren't just websites.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.480
They created branding impact,

15:56.480 --> 15:59.120
business growth and market credibility.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.360
Founders journey the real story.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.840
Behind every milestone are stories

16:05.840 --> 16:07.840
that never appear on a website.

16:07.920 --> 16:10.400
One of the founders, Mr. Maniganda Pandian,

16:10.400 --> 16:13.520
has been carrying one of the toughest responsibilities.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.840
Managing India in the Bayo operations.

16:15.840 --> 16:19.280
Not remotely, but by physically being there.

16:19.280 --> 16:21.280
Multiple flights every year.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.800
Living between regions.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.480
Switching time zones.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.680
Managing teams.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.520
Clients and commitments.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.560
All at once.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.040
Travel drains the body.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.520
Responsibility weighs on the mind.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.080
And growth demands constant upskilling

16:36.080 --> 16:37.760
and learning new technologies.

16:37.760 --> 16:40.000
Yet, he kept moving forward.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.600
And behind this strength stood something powerful.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.400
His family.

16:44.400 --> 16:45.680
Their patients.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.200
Their understanding.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.880
Their silent support.

16:48.880 --> 16:52.240
Because when a founder travels endlessly for a dream,

16:52.240 --> 16:54.480
the family travels emotionally with him.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.480
Standing strong alongside this journey is Ramiya,

16:58.480 --> 17:00.320
co-founder of Bebo Mind Apps.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.520
Every day, she has been holding together people,
