00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.980
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) And yes, I see those smiles.

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.060
I like that energy.

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.540
Alright, let's get started.

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.630
Your pin drop silence and your full attention

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.270
will help me present the WeberMindApps annual growth

6
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.810
story in the best possible way.

7
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.030
Dear WeberMindApps family, today is not just another

8
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.490
day.

9
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.910
Today is a moment to pause, look back

10
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.630
and feel proud.

11
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.210
Proud of 13 years of courage.

12
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.770
Proud of 13 years of growth.

13
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.450
Proud of 13 years of people who believed

14
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.990
in a dream and never gave up on

15
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.250
it.

16
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.450
Today, we are not just celebrating 13 years.

17
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.330
We are celebrating a journey.

18
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.970
A journey that started with two young minds.

19
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.970
No market knowledge, no roadmap, no experience in

20
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.730
running a company.

21
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.210
Only courage, commitment and countless challenges in hunting

22
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.930
for projects.

23
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.710
And they did not stop there.

24
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.550
Today, that same dream stands tall as a

25
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.790
45 member organisation powered by a bold vision

26
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.570
and a deep belief that quality work can

27
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.930
transform businesses.

28
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.510
With great pride that I welcome you all

29
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.690
to one of our greatest milestones.

30
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.750
13 years of success and the celebration of

31
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.130
our anniversary event, Webiverse 13.

32
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.950
Hooray!

33
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.390
A big round of applause please.

34
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.270
Thank you.

35
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.160
Let us see 2025 technology upgrade report.

36
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.320
We are a growing company and technology enhancement

37
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.720
is something must.

38
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.480
We learned, we improved, we delivered.

39
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.240
Let us take a look into the tech

40
00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.340
stack we upscale to.

41
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.140
Shopify plus and enterprise e-commerce.

42
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.800
Headless CMS and Next.js. Performance focused platforms.

43
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.380
3D, WebGL and immersive experiences.

44
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.580
DevOps engineer.

45
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.100
Motion graphics.

46
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.320
3D animations and modelling.

47
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.860
Automation, security and scalable systems.

48
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.720
AI voice and chat agents.

49
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.820
Oh, it's me.

50
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.620
Thank you for inventing me.

51
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.000
Jokes apart.

52
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.800
And finally, RAG based AI solutions.

53
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.920
This transformation didn't happen overnight.

54
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.180
It happened because of your persistence and purpose.

55
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.140
Come on team.

56
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.360
Let's hear a loud applause.

57
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.300
Thank you.

58
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.420
Now let us see 2025 quality that we

59
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.720
set.

60
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.400
Last year marked a shift from execution to

61
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.120
excellence.

62
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.800
Today, Webomind apps follows structured project kickoffs, clear

63
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.100
MOMs and SOPs.

64
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.000
Defined escalation matrices.

65
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.160
SLA tracking.

66
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.160
Multi-level QA cycles.

67
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.080
Strong security practises.

68
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.260
This discipline ensures one thing.

69
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.960
Quality is never compromised.

70
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.300
That is why clients stay.

71
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.260
That is why retainers grow.

72
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.640
That is why trust keeps multiplying.

73
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.100
But I heard Miss Ramya's loud voice at

74
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.400
designing team recently.

75
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.720
And was it about quality issue?

76
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.480
Jokes apart.

77
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.180
No doubt on quality.

78
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.080
We have gone way ahead.

79
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.680
Can I get the cheerful applause for all

80
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.480
quality upscale that we had in 2025 please?

81
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:46.690
Thank you.

82
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.840
Now let us see 2025 recruitment numbers.

83
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.780
If there is one year that truly defines

84
00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.680
our growth, it is the last year.

85
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.300
The number of resources hired was high compared

86
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.240
to previous years.

87
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.380
Multiple job openings and nearly 8000 applications from

88
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.780
Naukri, our website, LinkedIn, reference, phone calls, etc.

89
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.300
Not just that.

90
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.459
Multiple interviews and great shortlists.

91
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.300
We have hired 22 resources last year.

92
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.440
We added new team like motion graphic designing

93
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.860

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.660
Next JS and NodeJS team.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.300
Accounts team which we did not had before.

96
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.520
Now we have structured account books well managed.

97
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.580
Where is Priya?

98
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.360
Okay, okay, okay.

99
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.300
I can see her.

100
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.760
There she is.

101
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.480
Great work by the recruitment team and members

102
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.640
who supported in taking up the interviews.

103
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.000
Come on new joiners.

104
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.860
I am talking about you all.

105
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.120
A round of applause.

106
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.200
Thank you.

107
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.510
Now let us see the big projects that

108
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.270
we delivered in 2025.

109
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.870
Across fintech, agritech, manufacturing, e-commerce and SaaS.

110
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.030
Projects like Pine Labs, Cropin, Datanab, Webshop, Trinamix,

111
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:20.250
Honda, Riscovery, KP Manish, AeroWire, Eros Innovation and

112
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.810
many more.

113
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.030
These weren't just websites.

114
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.010
They created branding impact, business growth and market

115
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.650
credibility.

116
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.150
Team, did I miss anything?

117
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.770
Oh, how could you forget Witso?

118
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.270
It's all about me.

119
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.830
Ah, I don't need an applause.

120
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.030
I can give myself.

121
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.400
Now important part of the report 2025.

122
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.360
The growth report.

123
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.020
In the alone, Webermind apps achieved a 41

124
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.460
% revenue growth.

125
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.580
But more than numbers, what truly matters is

126
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.360
how we grew.

127
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.740
Team growth from 30 to 45.

128
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.200
New departments built, stronger internal processes, bigger and

129
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.240
more complex projects and a wider global footprint.

130
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.900
Today, 60% of our work serves India

131
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.080
and 40% serves international markets.

132
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.120
This growth was intentional.

133
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.820
This growth was earned.

134
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.720
This growth requires a huge round of applause.

135
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.440
Thank you.

136
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.910
Founders journey, the real story.

137
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.970
Behind every success, there is a sacrifice.

138
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.930
I'm talking about Mr. Manikanda Pandian.

139
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.470
Travelling every month from Dubai to Bangalore and

140
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.510
Bangalore to Dubai.

141
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.490
Managing two locations.

142
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.490
It's really not easy to stay away from

143
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.450
the family and homemade food.

144
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.950
Being founder who always initiate to find new

145
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.510
pathway to grow the company.

146
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.890
His innovation towards automation, marketing and training.

147
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.510
If I wonder there is a day he

148
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.830
does not checks his mail.

149
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.630
If there is a day that he does

150
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.810
not think on upscaling.

151
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.230
If there is a day where he sleeps

152
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.430
without thinking of company's growth.

153
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.970
His soft and gentle approach is always recognised

154
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.290
by every resource.

155
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.250
He could be leader to you.

156
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.410
He is very special to me.

157
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.170
Have you observed, he does the work with

158
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.470
calm.

159
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:35.250
His innocent smile and fearless eyes and...

160
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.270
Okay, okay, okay.

161
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.030
I forgot.

162
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.090
I'm at an anniversary celebration.

163
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.990
A big round of applause to this great

164
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.390
leader.

165
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.970
Standing strong alongside this journey is Ramya, co

166
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.870
-founder of Webo MindApps.

167
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.510
Every day she has been holding together people,

168
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.990
projects and promises.

169
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:02.190
Handling multiple resources, managing multiple clients, listening deeply,

170
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.770
understanding ambitions and turning challenges into real solutions.

171
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.930
She didn't just bring projects, she brought belief.

172
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.310
Belief to clients that Webo MindApps can deliver.

173
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.850
Belief to teams that their work matters.

174
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.870
From closing large and complex deals to giving

175
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.570
clients clarity, confidence and hope and ensuring every

176
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.150
commitment is successfully delivered through the team.

177
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.190
Her role in sales, communication and execution has

178
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.789
been one of the strongest pillars of Webo

179
00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:36.870
MindApps growth.

180
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:41.130
She is good but not like Mr. Manikanda

181
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:41.630
Pandian.

182
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.050
Anyways, let's give a round of applause for

183
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:44.330
her.

184
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.020
Thank you.

185
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.000
Founders cannot walk alone.

186
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.560
A special mention to Ramakrishna, our operations manager.
