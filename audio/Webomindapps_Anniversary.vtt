Dear Webber Mind Apps family, today is not just another day.

00:47.560 --> 00:53.000
Today is a moment to pause, look back and feel proud.

00:54.000 --> 01:07.600
Proud of 13 years of courage, proud of 13 years of growth, proud of 13 years of people who believed in a dream and never gave up on it.

01:08.800 --> 01:21.000
Today, we are not just celebrating 13 years, we are celebrating a journey, a journey that started with two young minds, no market knowledge, no road map, no experience in running a company.

01:21.200 --> 01:28.120
Only courage, commitment and countless challenges in hunting for projects and they did not stop there.

01:28.720 --> 01:46.240
Today, that same dream stands tall as a 45 member organization powered by a bold vision and a deep belief that quality work can transform businesses with great pride that I welcome you all to one of our greatest milestones.

03:11.440 --> 03:16.040
Last year marked a shift from execution to excellence today.

04:08.240 --> 04:11.240

04:12.640 --> 04:21.640
If there is one year that truly defines our growth it is the last year the number of resources hired was high compared to previous years.

Multiple job openings and nearly 8,000 applications from knockery our website linked in reference phone calls etc not just that multiple interviews and great short lists.

04:36.040 --> 04:39.640

05:20.640 --> 05:25.640
Across FinTech, AgriTech, Manufacturing, e-commerce and SaaS.

05:25.640 --> 05:38.640
Projects like Pine Labs, Cropin, DataNab, Webshop, Trinomix, Honda, RiscoVerry, KP Manish, EroWire, Eros Innovation and many more.

05:39.640 --> 05:45.640
These weren't just websites. They created branding impact, business growth and market credibility.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.640
Team, did I miss anything?

05:49.640 --> 05:53.640
Oh, how could you forget with so? It's all about me.

05:54.640 --> 05:58.640
Ah, I don't need an applause. I can give myself.

06:02.640 --> 06:07.640
Now important part of the report 2025, the growth report.

06:08.640 --> 06:13.640
In the alone, Webamined apps achieved a 41% revenue growth.

06:13.640 --> 06:18.640
But more than numbers, what truly matters is how we grew.

06:20.640 --> 06:26.640
Team growth from 30 to 45 new departments built stronger internal processes.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.640
Bigger and more complex projects and wider global footprint.

06:30.640 --> 06:36.640
Today's 60% of our work serves India and 40% serves international markets.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.640
This growth was intentional.

06:39.640 --> 06:43.640
This growth was earned. This growth requires a huge round of applause.

06:45.640 --> 06:46.640
Thank you.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.640
Founders journey, the real story.

06:54.640 --> 06:58.640
Behind every success, there is a sacrifice.

06:58.640 --> 07:02.640
I'm talking about Mr. Manikander Pandian.

07:02.640 --> 07:06.640
Traveling every month from Dubai to Bangalore and Bangalore to Dubai.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.640
Managing two locations.

07:08.640 --> 07:13.640
It's really not easy to stay away from the family and homemade food.

07:13.640 --> 07:18.640
Being founder, who always initiate to find a new pathway to grow the company.

07:18.640 --> 07:23.640
His innovation towards automation, marketing and training.

07:23.640 --> 07:26.640
If I wonder, there is a day he does not check his mail.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.640
If there is a day that he does not think on upscaling.

07:30.640 --> 07:34.640
If there is a day where he sleeps without thinking of company's growth.

07:34.640 --> 07:39.640
His soft and gentle approach is always recognized by every resource.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.640
He could be leader to you.

07:42.640 --> 07:44.640
He's very special to me.

07:44.640 --> 07:47.640
Have you observed he does the work with Kam?

07:47.640 --> 07:52.640
His inner sense smile and fearless eyes end.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.640
Okay, okay, okay, I forgot.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.640
I'm at an annuous recalibration.

07:57.640 --> 08:00.640
A big round of applause to this great leader.

08:03.640 --> 08:07.640
Standing strong alongside this journey is Ramiya,

08:07.640 --> 08:09.640
co-founder of Webo Mind Apps.

08:09.640 --> 08:11.640
Every day she has been holding together.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.640

To giving clients clarity, confidence and hope.

08:41.640 --> 08:46.640
And ensuring every commitment is successfully delivered through the team.

08:46.640 --> 08:50.640
Her role in sales, communication and execution.

08:51.640 --> 08:55.640
Has been one of the strongest pillars of Webo Mind Apps growth.

08:55.640 --> 08:57.640
She is good, but.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.640
Not like Mr. Manikanda Pandian.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.640
Anyways, let's go round of applause for her.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.640
I know why he's silent always.

09:29.640 --> 09:33.640
He's not like to speak anywhere by her.

09:34.640 --> 09:35.640
Come on, guys.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.640
He deserves a round of applause.
